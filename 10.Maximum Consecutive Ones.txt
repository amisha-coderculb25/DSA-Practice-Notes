Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
 


python 3
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        max_count = 0  # to keep track of the maximum number of consecutive 1s
        current_count = 0  # to count current streak of 1s

        for num in nums:
            if num == 1:
                current_count += 1
                max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            else:
                current_count = 0  # reset count if 0 is encountered

        return max_count
