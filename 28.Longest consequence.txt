128. Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,0,1,2]
Output: 3

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums):
        num_set = set(nums)
        longest = 0

        for num in num_set:
            # only check for start of sequence
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                current = num
                streak = 1

                while current + 1 in num_set:
                    current += 1
                    streak += 1

                longest = max(longest, streak)

        return longest
